            <h1>The Soul of Art</h1>
            <p>
                The soul of art comes from the delicate soul of the artist that imbues the artwork with life. A certain type of mastery requires sacrifice, where that sacrifice becomes palpable to a work of art. This is beyond appreciation where it is an external application of a person’s connection toward an artwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I appreciate that work because it moves me.” It is a declaration of a subjective experience. It can be found in every artwork, since it is in itself a declaration of a subjective experience. The appreciation comes as a response towards the artwork’s “prompt,” as if in experiencing an artwork, we engage in an idea where we only converse with the work we feel most connected to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every artwork is a letter in a bottle thrown into the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great art fleshes out a soul and a profound expression masterly crafted to evoke a certain human sensibility. Joy, pain, elation, and grief are among the common themes of art. To communicate that which is often uncontainable. Romanticists often call it the overflowing emotions. However, what overflows is often a sign of a lack of control. What overflows is often the things that we are unable to hold. This incapacity is a sign of the weakness of the mind – the immaturity of it in seeing the explosion of emotions like a volcano, the ravaging chaos that it incurs do not show confidence of one’s self-control. Going with the flow of emotions is a submission to man’s animalistic impulses.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes art great depends on the scope of human nature it is mirroring. It requires degrees of nuances, and a razor-sharp edge precision in showing the layers. It is the art of dissecting the human while keeping it alive.
