title: An Expanse of Breath
---
Command the present to eclipse this guilt. This restless
thrashing of a bent-necked joy: a future aborted, impended
and resigned, as if (hold my thoughts the way
water sits on the windowsill: the poem
lives on this memory) we are lying
to ourselves, when we say “I see you,” to another.
My god, disintegrate me to ashes
of your gaze, 
thriving in this false nakedness.
Let me elaborate. Take my fingers and deny
this body access to poetry.

Do I need to explain the poem in this?

Time withers. Spun 
out of a web of foreign languages. I am 
a consequence torn from the fabric of time 
and space. You are not here 
but you control my speech. Isn’t this 
a declaration of war? We seek 
the same unit of happiness: touch.

Forego the relentless pursuit of memory. 
My country lives with the abundance 
of trauma that resides in its history. I was born 
because pain entails that something 
good will come out of suffering. 
We are not the same. This land, 
this categorical existence of  a heritage, 
burrows under 
the eyelids of every single commuter. 

We are here 
but unaware of being here. I will 
tend to the careful desire of greed, 
that pompous primal voice 
of wanting. 

I will then recede to the womb. Mother, 
I have become you. A victim of 
the marriage of heaven and earth. 
I am unqualified to carry 
the burden of my own birth. Take me 
to the place of anger, of filth, 
of dramatis personae. Introduce me 
to my childhood memory long abandoned 
because of my naive desire 
to grow. Come, and let us pray.

Father, I am a victim of angels. 
I am owed a heaven that knows all 
about me. I am scared and trembling. 
Hold my hand, wash my feet, 
and cleanse me of this faith. To atone 
for the sins I’ve done, I will let you decide 
which I sin I will commit: I will not 
say the Lord’s prayer and I will not 
turn this memory into a poem. 

I want to stop believing 
that there is calmness in the waves. I want to stop 
believing about the chior of voices 
in the sea. Utterance. The utterance 
of guilt, a declaration 
of trust, and a forgotten bildungsroman.

I pray for a word that carries the spirit of youth. 
A poem is tasked to reveal Heaven. Poets are 
tasked to die without dying. Words are 
breathed to life and everytime a poet 
speaks, he takes a step closer to death.  A poem 
that only speaks about the superficiality of love 
is a poem made by a false prophet. They are 
the culprit to the massacre 
of meaning. Call out a thousand moons and muses.
