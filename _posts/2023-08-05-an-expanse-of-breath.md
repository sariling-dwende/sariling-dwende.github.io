title: An Expanse of Breath
---
<p>Command the present to eclipse this guilt. This restless<br>
thrashing of a bent-necked joy: a future aborted, impended<br>
and resigned, as if (hold my thoughts the way<br>
water sits on the windowsill: the poem<br>
lives on this memory) we are lying<br>
to ourselves, when we say “I see you,” to another.<br>
My god, disintegrate me to ashes<br>
of your gaze,<br>
thriving in this false nakedness.<br>
Let me elaborate. Take my fingers and deny<br>
this body access to poetry.</p>

<p>Do I need to explain the poem in this?</p>

<p>Time withers. Spun<br>
out of a web of foreign languages. I am<br>
a consequence torn from the fabric of time<br>
and space. You are not here<br>
but you control my speech. Isn’t this<br>
a declaration of war? We seek<br>
the same unit of happiness: touch.</p>

<p>Forego the relentless pursuit of memory.<br>
My country lives with the abundance<br>
of trauma that resides in its history. I was born<br>
because pain entails that something<br>
good will come out of suffering.<br>
We are not the same. This land,<br>
this categorical existence of a heritage,<br>
burrows under<br>
the eyelids of every single commuter.</p>

> <p>We are here<br>
but unaware of being here. I will<br>
tend to the careful desire of greed,<br>
that pompous primal voice<br>
of wanting.</p>

<p>I will then recede to the womb. Mother,<br>
I have become you. A victim of<br>
the marriage of heaven and earth.<br>
I am unqualified to carry<br>
the burden of my own birth. Take me<br>
to the place of anger, of filth,<br>
of dramatis personae. Introduce me<br>
to my childhood memory long abandoned<br>
because of my naive desire<br>
to grow. Come, and let us pray.</p>

<p>Father, I am a victim of angels.<br>
I am owed a heaven that knows all<br>
about me. I am scared and trembling.<br>
Hold my hand, wash my feet,<br>
and cleanse me of this faith. To atone<br>
for the sins I’ve done, I will let you decide<br>
which I sin I will commit: I will not<br>
say the Lord’s prayer and I will not<br>
turn this memory into a poem.</p>

<p>I want to stop believing<br>
that there is calmness in the waves. I want to stop<br>
believing about the chior of voices<br>
in the sea. Utterance. The utterance<br>
of guilt, a declaration<br>
of trust, and a forgotten bildungsroman.</p>

<p>I pray for a word that carries the spirit of youth.<br>
A poem is tasked to reveal Heaven. Poets are<br>
tasked to die without dying. Words are<br>
breathed to life and everytime a poet<br>
speaks, he takes a step closer to death.  A poem<br>
that only speaks about the superficiality of love<br>
is a poem made by a false prophet. They are<br>
the culprit to the massacre<br>
of meaning. Call out a thousand moons and muses.</p>
