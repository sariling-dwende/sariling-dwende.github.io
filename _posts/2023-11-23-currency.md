I may have reached the point where it has become difficult to capture the feeling of experiencing things for the first time. At the age of 27, I am feeling a kind of introspective loneliness, to say that it might be possible that I am carrying a type of solitude that grows bigger than what I can handle. I can feel it loom over me the more I age, as if this solitude is an invisible companion I had been nurturing throughout my life and only now did I have the ability to see it—once this loneliness has grown beyond me.

The city has become an amalgamation of memories of old lovers. Old pathways already marked by our fingerprints, the alleys mapped by our mind, and all those same roads we walk on every day, which upon sight, become submerged with the ordinariness of familiarity. What I am trying to say is I’m still looking for a poem Some things stay the same but rot away with time.

This is the time when I can feel the time slowly etching itself onto my skin. I can feel youth being transferred from me to the younger generation. making this unresolvable conflict of aging known to me. I become aware that I am slowly losing my steam with the rush of unrecognized novelty passing through me like a new form of language I am too old to comprehend. For the first time, the world is beginning to change and I am being left behind.
